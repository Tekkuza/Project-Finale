Description:

This tool uses the Financial Modeling Prep API to scrape and collect stock information. This requires the creation of an account, and use of an API token to collect data. Classes:

Stock scraper
    This class collects and requests data from the API. This is where you can select the type of information to scrape.

Menu
    This class ultimately was to become a selection area allowing you to choose the API searches to perform, as well as calculations. 

Storage and Calculation
    This class aimed to execute csv storage and calculation, but due to time constraints, it wasn't completed. This will be followed up.
